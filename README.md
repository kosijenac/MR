This repository contains my past class projects from the grad course "Computer Networks".

The following projects can be found here:
1. **HTTPS client**. A client program written in C for fetching an HTML file over the HTTP (*not* HTTPS) protocol.
2. **Meteo**. Contains one server program for keeping meteorological data and two client programs $-$ one authorized to edit the data on the server
and another only authorized to view it.
3. **NSlookup**. My own implementation of a simplified version of the nslookup command line tool.
